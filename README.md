# Zombies Reworked
Zombies Reworked is a mod that overhauls and changes the zombies in a better way! Ranging from small features to better AI system and better mechanics to make the mod a must need for apocalyptic minecraft modpacks. This mod has some code that our other mod, Rotted has, but better! This mod is pretty lightweight but also heavy configurable as it does not add that much content!


Now drowned zombies can be captured when...fishing?? Not only that, but players can turn into zombies now just as villagers can turn into zombie villagers! Zombies are smart enough to use items and perform certain actions? Yes! Everything in one place, put it all together in this particular mod!
